### try it here !
https://www.starterpack-hc.art

*its not super responsive so u'll have to unzoom the website until it fits ðŸ˜«*

*also kinda laggy on first loads, pls bear w me ðŸ˜ž*

### where i got the idea
theres a trend going on around the internet about "my starter pack" and its typically generated by AI. this also lead to artist create a new trend where they create their own starter pack by hand to show how much an art is better than any AI.

this is where i got the idea of creating a starter pack but users can customize it themselves without using AI. i've drew a few items, clothes, hair, and other stuffs for users to choose from so that they could still create their own starter pack even if they're not particularly interested in drawing their own and most especially not using an AI to generate these arts :D
